  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  
To run your application locally: `python manage.py start`
Your application will be running at local server.

Debugging locally
To debug a django project run python manage.py runserver with DEBUG set to True in settings.py to start a native django development server. This comes with the Django's stack-trace debugger, which will present runtime failure stack-traces. For more information, see Django's documentation.
